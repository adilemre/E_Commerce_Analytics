The shopper users can be grouped based on the purchase amount. A shopper made  662€ turnover on average in October. 
But on the other hand 75% of shoppers bought products that cost less than 595€. 
As a first step shoppers were divided into two groups,which are stars and regular customers. 
Star group was defined as customers with top 10% sales amount and the rest of the shoppers were labeled as regular customers. 
Users in the star group made 56% of total turnover in October.

Conclusion
First, one of the biggest marketing problems of e-commerce companies is customers, who visit websites but don't purchase 
anything. There were 2.7mio visitors, who left the website without shopping. Why did those customers visit your website ? 
What did they look for ? Why didn’t they buy one of the products that they viewed ? Didn’t they find what they were 
looking for ? Is it the price or is it the brand why they left your website without purchasing ?

Second, shopper customers need to be grouped as one timers and repeat customers. E-commerce companies need to make one 
timers to visit and purchase products again. On the other hand, repeat customers need to be retained by contacting them 
with promotions and product recommendations. Those contacts are called campaigns and they perform better when they are 
designed more personal.

Third, the value based customer segmentation can be used to determine customer groups that are most valuable and below the 
expectation. Usually companies label their most valuable customers as diamonds or stars. Those valuable customers are 
served special and their problems are handled with care because the acquisition cost of those customers are not low. 
Losing an existing valuable customer and gaining a new one is an expensive operation on both time and money. To understand 
customer value and behavior deeper, value based customer segments might be used with one timer and repeat customer groups.
