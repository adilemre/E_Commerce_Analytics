# E-Commerce Analytics

In this study, I worked on a user activity dataset of an e-commerce company website.

The main focus of the analysis is web analytic metrics and how they can be used to improve any e-commerce business.

The insights from this analysis are detailed on documents in the result directory.

My juniper notebook is also shared both in the notebooks directory and on the Kaggle website. (https://www.kaggle.com/adilemrebilgic/e-commerce-analytics) 

Thank you.
