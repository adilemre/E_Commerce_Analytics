In this section, the study focus changed from customer perspective to product perspective. The goal of this section is revealing the places of products and categories in the company's business. 

There are 166,794 products of 3,444 brands in 13 categories and 57 subcategories. They create  different levels of visitor traffic though the website and have various trade volumes and ratios. Some categories are more popular than others and some subcategories make more money among other categories. Categories should be assessed with both popularity and profits they made with subcategories. After this assessment, we will have a clear picture of the e-commerce business performance.

The first and the most important question is the purpose of users when they visit your website. There are 3 million unique customers who visited your website 9.2 million times during October. The top 3 categories with most visitors are electronics, appliances and computers. The favorite category is electronics which had 38% of total activities(view, purchase). The bar graphs below demonstrate visit and purchase summaries by categories.
